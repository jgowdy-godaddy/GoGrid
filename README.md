GoGrid Worker is a system tray application for running your own private distributed GPU compute network. Use idle GPU resources across your personal machines or corporate infrastructure to process AI inference workloads.

## Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **System Tray Application** - Runs quietly in the background
- üîÑ **Auto-Updates** - Seamlessly updates to the latest version
- üéÆ **GPU Accelerated** - Supports NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal
- üåê **Cross-Platform** - macOS (ARM64 & Intel), Linux, and Windows
- üìä **Real-time Stats** - Monitor job completion and GPU usage
- ‚ö° **Efficient** - Minimal resource usage when idle
- üîí **Private** - Run your own coordinator server

## Building from Source

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for detailed build instructions.

Quick build:

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jgowdy/GoGrid.git
cd GoGrid

# Build all platforms (current platform only)
./build_all_platforms.sh 0.1.0

# Or build specific components
cargo build --release --bin corpgrid-scheduler
cd crates/tray-app/src-tauri
cargo tauri build
```

## Architecture

GoGrid consists of three main components:

### 1. Worker (This Repository)

The client application that runs on user machines:
- **Scheduler** (`corpgrid-scheduler`) - Rust binary that executes GPU workloads
- **Tray App** (`gogrid-tray`) - Tauri-based GUI for user interaction
- Connects to coordinator via QUIC protocol
- Manages GPU resources and job execution

### 2. Coordinator (Included)

Central server that manages the network:
- **Coordinator** (`gogrid-coordinator`) - Connection management and job distribution
- Serves auto-update manifests and installers
- Handles worker registration and heartbeats
- Runs on `bx.ee:8443`

### 3. Job Queue (Separate)

Backend services for job management:
- Job submission and queueing
- Job prioritization
- Management dashboard
- (Not included in this repository)

## Auto-Updates

GoGrid Worker automatically checks for updates:
- **On startup** - After 5 second delay
- **Every 24 hours** - Background check
- **Silent download** - No interruption to current work
- **Smart restart** - Prompts only when convenient

Update server: `https://bx.ee:8443/updates/`

See [AUTO_UPDATE.md](AUTO_UPDATE.md) for technical details.

## Configuration

### Default Settings

The worker connects to `bx.ee:8443` by default. Settings can be configured through the tray menu:

- **Pause/Resume** - Stop accepting new jobs
- **GPU Settings** - Limit VRAM usage
- **Network Settings** - Custom coordinator URL
- **Dashboard** - View job statistics and GPU usage

Configuration is stored at:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/GoGrid Worker/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/gogrid-worker/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\GoGrid Worker\`

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/jgowdy/GoGrid.git
cd GoGrid

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run scheduler locally
cargo run --bin corpgrid-scheduler

# Run tray app in dev mode
cd crates/tray-app
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds:

- **Pull Requests** - Build and test all platforms
- **Main Branch** - Test builds on every commit
- **Tagged Releases** - Build all platforms and create GitHub release

See [.github/RELEASE.md](.github/RELEASE.md) for release process.

## Security

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities to: security@bx.ee

Do not open public issues for security concerns.

### Update Signing (TODO)

Currently, updates are not cryptographically signed. This will be added in a future release:

```bash
# Generate signing key
tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/gogrid.key

# Sign updates
tauri signer sign update.tar.gz
```

## Configuration

### Coordinator Endpoint

By default, GoGrid Worker connects to `bx.ee:8443`. To use your own coordinator:

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
export GOGRID_COORDINATOR_HOST=your-server.com
export GOGRID_COORDINATOR_PORT=8443
```

**macOS** (launchd):
```bash
# Edit ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gogrid.worker.plist
<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
<dict>
    <key>GOGRID_COORDINATOR_HOST</key>
    <string>your-server.com</string>
    <key>GOGRID_COORDINATOR_PORT</key>
    <string>8443</string>
</dict>
```

**Linux** (systemd):
```bash
# Create ~/.config/systemd/user/gogrid-worker.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
Environment="GOGRID_COORDINATOR_HOST=your-server.com"
Environment="GOGRID_COORDINATOR_PORT=8443"
```

**Windows**:
```cmd
setx GOGRID_COORDINATOR_HOST your-server.com
setx GOGRID_COORDINATOR_PORT 8443
```

### Update Server

The update endpoints are configured in `tauri.conf.json`. By default:
- Primary: `https://bx.ee:8443/updates/`
- Fallback: `https://gogrid-updates.example.com/updates/`

To host your own update server, see [AUTO_UPDATE.md](AUTO_UPDATE.md).
