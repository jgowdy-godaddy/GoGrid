# GoGrid Worker

**Distributed GPU Inference Network Client**

GoGrid Worker is a system tray application that allows you to contribute your idle GPU resources to the GoGrid distributed inference network. Earn rewards while your computer is idle by processing AI inference workloads.

## Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **System Tray Application** - Runs quietly in the background
- üîÑ **Auto-Updates** - Seamlessly updates to the latest version
- üéÆ **GPU Accelerated** - Supports NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal
- üåê **Cross-Platform** - macOS (ARM64 & Intel), Linux, and Windows
- üìä **Real-time Stats** - Monitor your earnings and jobs completed
- ‚ö° **Efficient** - Minimal resource usage when idle

## Building from Source

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for detailed build instructions.

Quick build:

```bash
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jgowdy/GoGrid.git
cd GoGrid

# Build all platforms (current platform only)
./build_all_platforms.sh 0.1.0

# Or build specific components
cargo build --release --bin corpgrid-scheduler
cd crates/tray-app/src-tauri
cargo tauri build
```

## Architecture

GoGrid consists of three main components:

### 1. Worker (This Repository)

The client application that runs on user machines:
- **Scheduler** (`corpgrid-scheduler`) - Rust binary that executes GPU workloads
- **Tray App** (`gogrid-tray`) - Tauri-based GUI for user interaction
- Connects to coordinator via QUIC protocol
- Manages GPU resources and job execution

### 2. Coordinator (Included)

Central server that manages the network:
- **Coordinator** (`gogrid-coordinator`) - Connection management and job distribution
- Serves auto-update manifests and installers
- Handles worker registration and heartbeats
- Runs on `bx.ee:8443`

### 3. Job Queue (Separate)

Backend services for job management:
- Job submission and queueing
- Payment processing
- User dashboard
- (Not included in this repository)

## Auto-Updates

GoGrid Worker automatically checks for updates:
- **On startup** - After 5 second delay
- **Every 24 hours** - Background check
- **Silent download** - No interruption to current work
- **Smart restart** - Prompts only when convenient

Update server: `https://bx.ee:8443/updates/`

See [AUTO_UPDATE.md](AUTO_UPDATE.md) for technical details.

## Configuration

### Default Settings

The worker connects to `bx.ee:8443` by default. Settings can be configured through the tray menu:

- **Pause/Resume** - Stop accepting new jobs
- **GPU Settings** - Limit VRAM usage
- **Network Settings** - Custom coordinator URL
- **Dashboard** - View earnings and statistics

Configuration is stored at:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/GoGrid Worker/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/gogrid-worker/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\GoGrid Worker\`

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/jgowdy/GoGrid.git
cd GoGrid

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run scheduler locally
cargo run --bin corpgrid-scheduler

# Run tray app in dev mode
cd crates/tray-app
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

### CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds:

- **Pull Requests** - Build and test all platforms
- **Main Branch** - Test builds on every commit
- **Tagged Releases** - Build all platforms and create GitHub release

See [.github/RELEASE.md](.github/RELEASE.md) for release process.

## Security

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please report security vulnerabilities to: security@bx.ee

Do not open public issues for security concerns.

### Update Signing (TODO)

Currently, updates are not cryptographically signed. This will be added in a future release:

```bash
# Generate signing key
tauri signer generate -w ~/.tauri/gogrid.key

# Sign updates
tauri signer sign update.tar.gz
```
